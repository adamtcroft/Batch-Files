# Batch Files
## My personal collection of custom Windows batch files
I enjoy using the command line a bunch, particularly just to have more fun.
These custom batch files are built primarily for that purpose -- fun first, and a bit of productivity.
Check out the list of what I've made below, and feel free to clone this repo and use them!

### &#x1F538; BEFORE YOU USE THESE! &#x1F538;
After you clone the repo I _highly_ suggest you add that directory to your Windows PATH environment variables.
If you're unsure of how to do that, Google "add environment variables Windows (your version)"

## All commands included in the repo:
1. **google.bat** -- Allows google search via CMD with Firefox, Chrome, or another default browser

2. **listFiles.bat** -- Creates a .txt file of all files in the current directory

3. **ls.bat** -- Prints a clean list of all files in the current directory (removes the junk of "dir")
