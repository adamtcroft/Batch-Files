# Batch Files
## My personal collection of custom Windows batch files
I enjoy using the command line a bunch, particularly just to have more fun.
These custom batch files are built primarily for that purpose -- fun first, and a bit of productivity.
Check out the list of what I've made below, and feel free to clone this repo and use them!

### &#x1F538; BEFORE YOU USE THESE! &#x1F538;
After you clone the repo I _highly_ suggest you add that directory to your Windows PATH environment variables.
If you're unsure of how to do that, Google "add environment variables Windows (your version)"

## All commands included in the repo:
1. **aliases.bat** -- Likely useless to you - creates "aliases", or text shortcuts to commands, executables, etc.  You could use it as a template to make your own!

2. **build.bat** -- If using Windows, and you've setup your PATH variables and vcvarsall.bat, you can compile with the Visual Studio compiler from the command line and get rid of VS and its mess all together.

3. **calendar.bat** -- Opens Google Calendar in your default browser

4. **copydir.bat** -- Copies the path to the directory you're currently in to the clipboard

5. **cycleIP.bat** -- A quick way to cycle ipconfig release & renew

6. **explore.bat** -- Opens the current directory in Windows File Explorer

7. **fixCortana.bat** -- My start menu broke once, and this command is how I fixed it.  For safekeeping...

8. **github.bat** -- Opens Github.com in your default browser

9. **gitpunch.bat** -- Runs git add/status/commit -am/push all at once, for efficiency

10. **gmail.bat** -- Opens Gmail in your default browser

11. **givmServer.bat** -- Simplifies the gvim --remote command, especially if you have two windows open

12. **listFiles.bat** -- Creates a .txt file of all files in the current directory

13. **ls.bat** -- Prints a clean list of all files in the current directory (removes the junk of "dir")

14. **search.bat** -- Start a search using any browser, with your default search engine.  Special -f and -c for Firefox or Chrome

15. **startup.bat** -- A simple file to help hook in the aliases command at PC startup

16. **tobuild.bat** -- When run in conjuntion with build.bat, gets to the build folder quickly
